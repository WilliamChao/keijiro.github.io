Keijiro Takahashi

I’m a game developer and software engineer. I worked at [Sony Computer
Entertainment][SCEI] for ten years, and currently working for [Unity
Technologies][Unity]. I have [many open source projects][Repos], and devote a
substantial portion of time to developing them. Sometimes I collaborate with
musicians and make [visual effects][Nyolfen] for their live concerts.

Also I'm a musician, as formerly known as [Denkitribe][YouTube]. My main
interest is in transforming synthesized sound into musical pieces. If you're
interested, visit my [YouTube][YouTube] and [Soundcloud][Soundcloud] page.
