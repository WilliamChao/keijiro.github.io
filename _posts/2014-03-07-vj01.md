VJ01

VJ01 is a collaborative work with musician and game producer [Masaya Matsuura][Masaya]. The initial motivation for this project is attempting to use game technology to create live visual art, and searching for its possibilities and boundaries.

In the process of this work, several Unity plugins are created to add capabilities such as [Syphon frame sharing][Funnel], [MIDI controller connection][MIDIJack] and [audio reactive behaviors][Reaktion]. These assets and knowledge are shared with the community through several [events][Unite] and channels.
