Orbita

Orbita is the second attempt at making a novel music making system based on a physical behavior. Similar to the previous project [Arpie][Arpie], it turns movements of objects into musical sequences. This time, itâ€™s not bouncing ball -- it uses Newtonian gravity and planetary orbits.

Orbita is available on [iTunes App Store][iTunes], and its source code is provided under the open source license.
