VJ02

VJ02 is a visual effects program which was made for a live session with musician [Nyolfen][Nyolfen]. The effects are derived with inspiration from his musical style -- sharp and progressive, but has classical tonality.

The program itself was made with [Unity][Unity] and the plugin called [Reaktion][Reaktion] which was previously implemented for [VJ01][VJ01]. All the assets and source code are provided under the open source license and freely [available on GitHub][GitHub].
