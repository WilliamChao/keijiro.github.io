Reaktion

Reakition is a toolkit for making audio reactive behavior in [Unity][Unity]. It consists of three types of components; *Injectors* for receiving audio signals, *Reaktor* for measuring the level of signals and providing it as animation parameters, and *Gears* for controlling objects with the parameters. Combinations of these components make it possible to create a complex audio reactive behavior without coding.

Reaktion is provided under the open source license, and available on GitHub.
