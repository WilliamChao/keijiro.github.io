Reaktion

Reakition is a toolkit for making audio reactive behavior in Unity. It consists of several types of components; *Injectors* for receiving audio signals, *Reaktor* for converting signals into values, and *Gears* for controlling objects with the values. Combinations of these components make complex audio reactive behavior without coding.

Reaktion is provided under the open source license, and available on GitHub.
