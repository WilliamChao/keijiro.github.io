Funnel

Funnel is a Syphon server plugin for [Unity][Unity]. It allows camera objects in Unity to share its rendered frames with other applications via the [Syphon][Syphon] technology. This technology has been supported in many graphics applications on Mac OS X, such as [VDMX][VDMX] and [MadMapper][MadMapper], and because of its great flexibility and performance efficiency, it gives Unity an extra level of expressiveness at almost zero performance loss.

Funnel is provided under the open source license and available on GitHub.
