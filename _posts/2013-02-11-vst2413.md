VST2413

VST2413 is an attempt on deriving a chiptune synthesizer plugin based on the PC emulator technology. This [VST][VST] plugin emulates the [Yamaha YM2414][YM2413] FM synthesizer chip (as known as OPLL), and can resemble the sound of old game consoles and PCs, such as [SEGA Master System][SMS] and [MSX-AUDIO][MSX].

The original source code of the emulator ([emu2413.c][Emu]) was written by Mitsutaka Okazaki, and due to its great quality, it replicates the sound of the original chip at extremely low CPU load.

The plugin and its source code are available under the open source license.
